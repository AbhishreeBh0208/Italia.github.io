                    Roma is the perfect personification of our fascist ideology. She is motherly towards her children as is the Primer towards the citizens. She showers destruction who challenges her sovereignty with deadly courage, bravery and extraordinary resilience, something the Italians, all of us, share. We will always be unyielding towards the manipulations of the Allies, who are trying every bit to push us, our determination and suppress our vision. However, they do not stand any chance when all of our Italia stands together, protecting the Fatherland and all the dreams it has given birth to. Long live Italy!

                Aside from monetary funds, a normal citizen can achieve a lot. Your support itself is the fuel of our flame of change. We urge the fertile women, blessed by Venus, to give rise to life, sharing the same blood fueling our revolution. We also urge all the citizens to remain vigilant and aware of Allied spies who are proficient in brain washing and even spreading mass-killing sprees across lands, the very thing the Fascists are trying to prevent. Housing, hiding or providing homage to any such spies with resources which should be fed to our own army will be considered treason against the Romanita, something the Primer will take care of as Jupiter would. We urge you to convert your passion of your own Fascist vision into a manifesto or a pictorial representation which will connect you to many of the other members of the Fascist family who share a common goal. It will also be a warning to the Allies, whose feet will tremble after seeing the rising passion in each and every citizen of our Romanita. Recognise your own vision as ours, All for the state, Nothing outside the state, Nothing against the state.
