                The sons of our Romanita are fighting on the frontlines and our Primer wants nothing short of perfection for them. The best healthcare and the best nutrition, so that the soldiers of change remain in good health and ensure victory in every encounter, defying death, disease and starvation. We, as a single family of Fascists, must supplement our sons on the frontlines fighting a war which complement the desires of all of us. 
            </p>
            <p class="donate-details__text">
                We call upon the daughters of our Italia cladded in white to refresh the wounded sons with their healing touch and rejuvenate the Royal Army. The daughters of Epione, blessed with the care associated with recovery, soothing pain is what the Primer urges you to contribute in this war of righteousness. We call upon the Cornucopias of Italy, the farmers, to supplement these warriors with food so that our battalions never go to war with an empty stomach and bring back fulfilment of the wishes of their well-wishers who filled provided them with food equivalent to ambrosia and nectar. 
            </p>
            <p class="donate-details__text">
                Indirectly, each and every citizen of our Romanita can contribute towards the victory and the re-emergence of our golden Roman empire. Donations, in Liers, are appreciated, and often showcased here, signifying our gratitude to the thousands of citizens who recognise their own dream with us, within their Fascist courageous hearts, which was earlier diluted by evils brought upon by Allies.

                            Bianca Ricci, mother of 2 sons and a daughter recently donated 1 Lier from her savings, after sending both of her sons to enroll in the Royal Italian Army and enrolling her daughter to be a nurse in the army camps. She recognises her own dream along with her children, who are frontlining in these testing times, she encourages you to do the same.

                            Lorenzo Esposito, aged 32, is a farmer owning a farm after his fatherâ€™s death in the frontlines due to untreated illness. He recently donated 0.5 Liers so that no one else faces the same painful fate as his father and regularly supplies fresh fruits, vegetables and grains for nutrition. He urges all the fellow members of the Fascist family to do the same for their sisters and brothers in arms. 
                        </p>

                            Carina and Matteo Romano (aged 16yrs, 17yrs) recently signed up for the army and the media after donating 2 Liers, after their parents died in a bombing in Naples done by the cruel Allies. There are several children like them who are orphaned every second due the ruthless and merciless thoughts of the Allies, who care nothing other than personal selfish goals, and are a hindrance to the fulfilment of the dreams of our Romanita.
