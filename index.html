                    Life as we fascists understand means elevation and conquest. It must be full and lofty, it must be lived for oneself but above all, lived both nearby and far off the present and future. We want the nation to come together in unity with us for our own benefit, for our salvation. For so long, each of us has been restrained by the prisons of land, and now our beloved Romanita can finally spread her wings to march to the oceans. Each of us has been setting our hearts to make our Romanita reach her former glory, and that is exactly what we fascists promise to you. Our beloved Primer Benito Mussolini will wake Roma and Victoria and restore the golden period of redemption.

                    Today we stand on crossroads, a choice faced by all of us which will determine our fate: if the whole wide world will remember us, for sticking on our ground, being victorious in a test of our determination and courage; a war whose sounds will resonate till eternity or will we defer from the challenge, like those of the allied countries. The hardships, suffering and sacrifices that are faced with exemplary courage and dignity by the Italian people will have their day of compensation when all the enemy forces are crushed on the battlefields by the heroism of our soldiers and a triple, immense cry will cross the mountains and oceans like lightning and light new hopes and give new certainties to spirit multitudes

                    Our Primer is remaking Italy on the dreams of the virtuous warriors who laid down their lives in service of our Romanita. The vision of Alighieri is being realised and fulfilled, and now Italy needs its sons and daughters to lead the eternal flame of victory through these dark times of uncertain war.  O brave men, Bellona has blessed us with strong and undefeatable hearts, and all of Italy calls upon you, the brave men, the nourishing mothers and the passionate youth to recognise the fascists as your own. Realising the same dream of glory, and sharing the same path to success and prosperity, all together.

                    We, the fascists, aligned with the FÃ¼hrer and the japanese emperor, Hirohito, have formed the Axis powers, with its morale constituting the vision of its people, which is not just winning the war and emerging victorious, but to look after all our interests. The unity of all the axis powers in military and political fronts have revolutionised this war. We constitute the highest soldiers and the humblest generals. And we need your help to combat the mind games allies are so proficient in playing, how they have robbed the catholic church and made the farmers poor because of its so-called modern Capitalism, among many others. This war will raise the curtain off their foolish theoretical practices of Capitalism and Democracy, showcasing their real intention of tricking the common man and stealing its rights
